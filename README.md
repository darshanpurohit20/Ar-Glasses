## About  
Ar-Glasses is a stylish, lightweight augmented-reality web/phone application built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and WebGL/three.js (or similar) to simulate an AR glasses experience in the browser.  
It aims to deliver a real-time overlay of digital content on camera/video input, creating a wearable‐glasses feel — perfect for demos, prototypes, and creative experiments.

## Features  
- Web application accessible via modern browsers; mobile support included.  
- AR-style overlay of digital graphics/text on live video feed or uploaded media.  
- Adjustable styles/themes (e.g., sepia/monochrome filter, glasses “frame” overlay).  
- Responsive design: works on desktop webcams as well as phone cameras.  
- Modular/reactive architecture: easily add new glasses frames, filters, interaction modes.  
- Optimised performance for smooth experience in browser.
